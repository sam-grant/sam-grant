### Hello there 

I am **Samuel Grant**, a physicist from the U.K. The repositories below mostly contain code written for my Ph.D. research at the Fermilab Muon $g-2$ experiment. 

- [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM): analysis code centred on extracting a muon electric dipole moment (EDM) signal from large datasets.

- [ReadNTup](https://github.com/sam-grant/ReadNTup): code for reading in data in the form of ROOT Ntuples, applying corrections, and producing the analysis level histograms used in [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM). 

- [RadialField](https://github.com/sam-grant/RadialField): analysis code for estimating the magnitude of the radial component of the Fermilab $g-2$ storage ring magnetic field. Code relating to direct radial field measurements, and toy Monte Carlo measurements, can be found in [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM).

- [Tex](https://github.com/sam-grant/Tex): LaTeX code, including my Ph.D. thesis and various other things. 

- [LowDCAs](https://github.com/sam-grant/LowDCAs), [LowDCAs_v2](https://github.com/sam-grant/LowDCAs_v2), and [LowDCAs_v3](https://github.com/sam-grant/LowDCAs_v3): work on improvements to the g-2 particle tracking algorithm, with a focus on tracks which pass the sense-wire at a low 'distance of closest approach'. 

- [EpRatio](https://github.com/sam-grant/EpRatio): studies on using track-cluster matching (identifying common particle hits recorded by two independent detector systems) to cross-check measurements of calorimeter gain variations by taking the ratio of cluster energy, E, and track momentum, p, as a proxy for gain.

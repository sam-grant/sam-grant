### Hello there 

I am **Samuel Grant**, a physicist and programmer from the U.K. The repositories below contain code written for my Ph.D. research at the Fermilab Muon $g-2$ experiment. 

- [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM): analysis code centred on extracting an electric dipole moment (EDM) signal from large datasets.

- [ReadNTup](https://github.com/sam-grant/ReadNTup): code for reading in data in the form of ROOT Ntuples, applying corrections, and producing the analysis level histograms used in [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM). 

- [RadialField](https://github.com/sam-grant/RadialField): analysis code for estimating the size of radial magentic field in the Fermilab $g-2$ storage ring based. Code relating to direct radial field measurements can be found in [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM). 

- [Tex](https://github.com/sam-grant/Tex): LaTeX code, containing my Ph.D thesis among other things.

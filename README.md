### Hello there 

I am **Samuel Grant**, a researcher in high energy physics from the UK. The repositories below mostly contain code written for my PhD research at the Fermilab Muon $g-2$ experiment. 

- [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM): analysis code centred on extracting a muon electric dipole moment (EDM) signal from large datasets.

*High momentum tracks modulated over a 70 µs period, showing the spin precession oscillation caused by the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon, fitted with a five-parameter function. The measured phase of this oscillation is used to fit for the oscillation that would be caused by an EDM.*

*The average vertical decay angle of emitted positrons modulated over one spin precession period, fitted with a sinusoidal function of two orthogonal terms. The component of the oscillation attributed to an EDM is π/2 out-of-phase with anomalous spin precession oscillation, where the amplitude of this component is hidden with a blind offset.*

- [ReadNTup](https://github.com/sam-grant/ReadNTup): code for reading in data in the form of ROOT Ntuples, applying corrections, and producing the analysis level histograms used in [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM). 

- [RadialField](https://github.com/sam-grant/RadialField): analysis code for estimating the magnitude of the radial component of the Fermilab $g-2$ storage ring magnetic field. Code relating to direct radial field measurements, and toy Monte Carlo measurements, can be found in [EDM](https://github.com/sam-grant/EDM).

- [Tex](https://github.com/sam-grant/Tex): LaTeX code, including my Ph.D. thesis and various other things. 

- [LowDCAs](https://github.com/sam-grant/LowDCAs), [LowDCAs_v2](https://github.com/sam-grant/LowDCAs_v2), and [LowDCAs_v3](https://github.com/sam-grant/LowDCAs_v3): work on improvements to the g-2 particle tracking algorithm, with a focus on tracks which pass the sense-wire at a low 'distance of closest approach'. 

- [EpRatio](https://github.com/sam-grant/EpRatio): studies on using track-cluster matching (identifying common particle hits recorded by two independent detector systems) to cross-check measurements of calorimeter gain variations by taking the ratio of cluster energy, E, and track momentum, p, as a proxy for gain.
